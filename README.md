!The idea was to create an e-commerce for a custom made product. </br>
!! When opening https://capstone-ashen-kappa.vercel.app/ wait a few moments for the server to get online (they're sleepy!) </br>
<i> In german we say "kurz gesagt" in english <b>tldr</b>, on this webpage you can simply add your custom made products as an admin, while customers can add their thought, desires and reviews about what they've purchased! </i>
</br>
<b>PLEASE PAY ATTENTION</b> </br>
you need the following "items" to make it work

<ol>
  <li>DB like Mongo</li>
  <li>JWT</li>
  <li>Cloudinary</li>
  <li>Email host such as google for welcome mail</li>
  <li>Deploy on Render and Vercel, which you have to add to the variables of both</li>
</ol>
